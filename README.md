# Network Analysis

## Quantitative network metrics
1. Number of routes (remove this if all our networks have 30 routes by the end)
2. Total number of stops
3. Network diameter (longest shortest path)
4. Shortest route and longest route
5. Average path length
6. Average stops per route
7. Fitness function scores (values for each of connectivity, robustness, vulnerability, and the coverage)

## Qualitative analysis
1. In general, how visually connected is the network?
2. What major roads does the network run through and has multiple stops in?
3. Which transportation stops (which train stations or bus stops) does the jeepney routes connect to the most?
4. Are there many intersections between routes in the network?
5. Are the routes concentrated in a few areas or is the general coverage in the city good? Are there areas that are difficult to reach in the city through the jeepney routes?
6. Which amenities are reachable through multiple routes?
7. Make a few case studies (e.g. take a couple of notable amenities like DLSU campus, check how reachable it is, how many routes go into it and out of it, etc)
